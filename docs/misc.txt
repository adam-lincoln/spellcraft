One of my personal favorite custom games in Warcraft III is Spellcraft by The Zizz, a legendary Map Maker who brought us titles like:
Uther Party
Hungry Hungry Felhounds
Darwin's Island
Dalaran University

But this particular custom map gives you the power to craft your favorite original spells from Warcraft III by mixing three elements on your inventory, you can even level up this acquired spells and skills by mixing the same combo again up to level 3!, So this basically gives you the power to make a "Custom Hero" with the abilities you want him to have.

Besides that, the game has MANY modes to choose from like:
Hunter - You are given time to pick elements scattered on the floor to then fight against the rest of the party
Survivor - Each player is located in a closed chamber from where he needs to spawn foes against the others players, there's a store where to buy elements to craft the spells
Strife - Kinda like DOTA or Enfo's the players work together to conquer the enemy base through three corridors, non controllable ally units will spawn to help the cause.
Gradiator - All the players fight together against waves of enemies, after a certain number of waves Bosses will appear after killing them the team will be given random elements to craft their spells, this one needs a lot of team work
Battle - The players have a base kinda like in Footies and can creep for elements and regenerate mana in the common middle of the map, last one standing wins
Conquest - Pick up the elements you want from different chambers that you need to control, kinda like RISK
Mode X - Pick your desired element and kill the unit bearing it to get it


The Elements you can use are: fire, water, storm, energy, earth, dark, light and the Glyph of Chaos, mix three of these elements in your inventory to get a spell, Here is the WHOLE spell list so you can print it out and start making strategies for the different modes in the game, or you can also DOWNLOAD the list in a Word Document HERE
